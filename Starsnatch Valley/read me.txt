~STARSNATCH VALLEY V 0.2~

Maybe I should have called this Ceciliadew Valley or something. It would have been prettier, but the pun was just too good.

Anyhow this update was brought to you by two of my fiancee's mains, Lumine and the Raiden Shogun. Their hats are called "Inteyvat Hairpins" and "Raiden's Hairpins", specifically.

All hairs are inspired by the game Genshin Impact, which I do not own.

To use this mod you need Fashion Sense, available at https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9969

If you take screenshots, please tag me in them @starmadeshadows on Twitter so I can see the shenanigans you get up to.

If you're following this project, thank you for all your feedback! Life's gotten wacky, but I hope to continue working on your requests little by little (=^???^=))???

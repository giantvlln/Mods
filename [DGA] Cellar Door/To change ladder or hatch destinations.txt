To change where the ladder or hatch take you

I'm sorry but this is the only way I could get it to work. If you can help, please let me know on the Nexus.

In game, move your character to you want to end up. In the SMAPI console, type:

debug ppp

and take note of the (X,Y) coordinates. Close the game and open furniture.json in a text editor. For the hatch or ladder, replace the two numbers in every "Action": "Warp # # Farm/Cellar" with your coordinates. There are 12 sets to replace for the hatch and 1 set for the ladder. Make sure you only change the numbers, everything else should look the same! Save the file and open the game to try it out.

Suggested coordinates (vanilla farms):
Right of house, just above mailbox (default) - 70, 15
Right of house, further up - 70, 13
Left of house, further up - 56, 13

Ladder: 
Left of staircase (default) - 2, 7
Right of staircase - 5, 7

If SMAPI throws red errors you may have made a mistake, just delete and reinstall the mod and start over. If errors persist, feel free to ask on the Nexus page for help.

Good luck!
